Visualisations for a study of long-run interst rates

This folder contains the data and code for visualisations of OECD and World Bank data on long-term interest rates, inflation and total factor productivity. I prepared these visualisations as part of a research porject to fulfil the requirements of the unit ECF5421 Applied Macroeconomics, taught at Monash Univiersity.
